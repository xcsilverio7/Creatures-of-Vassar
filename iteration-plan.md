## Iteration Plan
The first use case we plan to work on is add-pin. Since most other use cases connect
to add pin, it is essential to add first. Specifically, the first thing to implement
is Google Maps integration. The user should be able to view Vassar College within the app
using Google Maps. This is the first thing we will implement, as it is critical to 
all other use cases. We also need to make sure that our app can access the users location,
and connect that to google maps. That would be the second step to implementing add-pin. After that,
we would work on actually allowing the user to place a pin, and saving that
location to the server. Then, we would work on being able to pull pin data from the server and 
display it on the map view. 

Some of this will be difficult while doing the text based prototype. Even in this prototype, we want to be able to read
the users location as coordinates, and get coordinate data
from Google Maps.

After add-pin is finished, our second priority would be upload-photo,
since it is directly connected to add pin. Our next priority after that
would be add-ID.

## Second Iteration
The next use case we plan on working on is upload-photo. The user should be able to upload pictures of animals
they spot. After the user places the pin, the app should have access to the user's camera roll and camera to upload the pictures.
This will be difficult to do in the text-based prototype, so this use case will be an Android-based iteration, 
not a text-based one. 

## Third Iteration 
There are two use cases we plan on working on in the third iteration. The first one is upload-photo. 
The user should be able to upload pictures of animals they spot. After the user places the pin, our app should have 
access to the user's camera roll and camera to upload. The next use case is like-pin. After a user selects the pin, 
they should be able to click a button that will increment the number of likes the pin has. The user can also remove
a like on the pin, and its number of likes should decrease. We also need to add internet functionality, so users on
different devices can see and interact with others pins.
